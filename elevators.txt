elevator concurrency project:

Create an elevator simulation and algorithm in C

General:
- simulates F floors and E elevators specified by the user
- there are R - V people living on each floor, which is the rooms on each floor, and the # of people vacant

Building:
- up/down call buttons on each floor

People:
- decide which floors to visit based on a weighted list
	- weighs the ground floor and home equally
	- other floors have chance of having a weight (low)

Elevator:
- arbitrary algorithm/state machine for deciding where to stop
	- can be easily swapped out without affecting rest of the functionality

Measurement:
- average wait time of people per floor



How it works:
