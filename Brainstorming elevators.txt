Brainstorming elevators:

- Create elevators (get back a manager for them)


- People can call elevator to a floor
	- This will trigger a condition variable on the person to sleep until elevator arrives

- Once elevator arrives, cond_broadcast to everyone on the floor
	- Each person wakes up, acquires lock and enters elevator
	- Once there's no one else waiting, or if capacity is full, signal to elevator to leave

- At the end of this process, the elevator determines a new destination depending on where it's called to

- Elevator moves on a tick-system
